# Logarithm

Base-10 logarithm of a number is also implemented.

```dart
print(log10(100));  // Output: 2.0
```

Compute the natural logarithm of of a number using the function below. It also supports computes logarithm to any base.

```dart
// Natural log of `e`
print(log(math.e));  // Output: 1.0

//log to any base. Example log to base 10 on 100
print(log(100, 10)); // prints: 2.0
```

Compute the logarithm of a number to a given base.

```dart
print(logBase(10, 100));  // Output: 2.0
print(logBase(2, 8));  // Output: 3.0
print(logBase(2, 32));  // Output: 5.0
```
