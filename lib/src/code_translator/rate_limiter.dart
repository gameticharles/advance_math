/// A utility class that implements rate limiting functionality.
///
/// This class is used to ensure that a particular section of code is not
/// executed more than a certain number of times within a specified interval.
///
/// Parameters:
/// - `maxRequests`: The maximum number of requests allowed within the interval.
/// - `interval`: The time interval in which the number of requests is counted.
///
/// Example:
/// ```
/// // Create a new rate limiter that allows 10 requests per minute.
/// var rateLimiter = RateLimiter(maxRequests: 10, interval: Duration(minutes: 1));
///
/// // Example function that performs an action that should be rate-limited.
/// void performAction() {
///   try {
///     rateLimiter.checkRateLimiting();
///     print('Action performed.');
///   } on Exception catch (e) {
///     print(e);
///   }
/// }
///
/// // Simulate performing actions.
/// for (int i = 0; i < 15; i++) {
///   performAction();
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Expected output if called 15 times in a loop:
/// ```
/// Action performed.
/// Action performed.
/// Action performed.
/// ... // repeated until the 10th print statement
/// Exception: Rate limit exceeded. Please try again later.
/// ```
