/// A class that represents a quadratic equation that
/// implementation of [Polynomial] that represents a second degree
/// polynomial equation in the form _ax^2 + bx + c = 0_.
///
/// The coefficients a, b, and c are numbers, and a cannot be 0.
///
/// This equation has exactly 2 roots, both real or both complex, depending
/// on the value of the discriminant.
///
/// The solutions of the equation are given by the formula:
/// _x = [-b Â± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a_
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// var quadratic = Quadratic(1, -3, 2);
/// print(quadratic.roots()); // Output: [2.0, 1.0]
/// print(quadratic.vertex()); // Output: Point(1.5, -1.0)
